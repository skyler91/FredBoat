## Status of this repo
This repo is no longer maintained and is not ready to work Discord's new intent system. FredBoat is still being actively developed in private by me as part of [BotLabs](https://botlabs.gg/).

In the end, FredBoat was never very good for selfhosting, and this has shown with the decrease in engagement in this repo. At some point in the future, I might create a self-contained stripped-down version of FredBoat intended for this purpose. Please email me if you'd be interested in using or collaborating on such a project.

Thanks to all contributors over the years! I am still grateful for all the help I've received.
